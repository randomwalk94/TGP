# TGP

Instructions for TGP Algorithm:

- tgp.m: The file implements the TGP algorithm as a function. The **tgp** function takes in measurement matrix A and data vector b and outputs the signal.
- tgpthresh.m: The file implements finding the thresholding parameter $\tau$ as a function. The **tgpthresh** function take in mmeasurement matrix A and outputs $\tau$.
- main_tgp.m: The file experiments TGP algorithm in the setting of Gaussian measurement matrix. *RUN THIS FILE*
